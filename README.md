# piRNA databases
Comparing existing piRNA databases  
In this project we compare piRNA databases that have been updated   
recently so as understand the main differences and how can be utilised.  

Databases in comparison are:  
piRBase v2.0 http://www.regulatoryrna.org/database/piRNA/  
piRNAdb v1.8 https://www.pirnadb.org/
